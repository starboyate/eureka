/**
 * Task dispatcher takes task from clients, and delegates their execution to a configurable number of workers.
 * The task can be processed one at a time or in batches. Only non-expired tasks are executed, and if a newer
 * task with the same id is scheduled for execution, the old one is deleted. Lazy dispatch of work (only on demand)
 * to workers, guarantees that data are always up to date, and no stale task processing takes place.
 * <h3>Task processor</h3>
 * A client of this component must provide an implementation of {@link TaskProcessor} interface, which will do
 * the actual work of task processing. This implementation must be thread safe, as it is called concurrently by
 * multiple threads.
 * <h3>Execution modes</h3>
 * To create non batched executor call {@link TaskDispatchers#createNonBatchingTaskDispatcher(String, int, int, long, long, TaskProcessor)}
 * method. Batched executor is created by {@link TaskDispatchers#createBatchingTaskDispatcher(String, int, int, int, long, long, TaskProcessor)}.
 * 创建任务分发器
